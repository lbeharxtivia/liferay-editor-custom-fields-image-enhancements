## Getting Started

This is meant to be imported into a client extension. Since this is the first app using the framework, it's already included as an example.

- In a terminal, navigate to your Liferay workspace's _client-extensions_ folder
- Clone the client extension into your folder using `git clone git@github.com:lbeharxtivia/liferay-editor-custom-fields-client-extension.git`
- Run `blade gw clean deploy` to deploy your new client extension

## Creating Liferay Content/Fragments with the provided files

A web content structure, web content template, fragment config, and fragment HTML have been provided for you at https://github.com/lbeharxtivia/liferay-editor-custom-fields-image-enhancements/tree/7.4/docs. Use those to create structured Web Content and Fragments respectively.
